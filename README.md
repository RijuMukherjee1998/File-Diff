# File-Diff

===================== > TO MAKE DOWNLOADS MUCH SMALLER < ======================================

OBJECTIVE: TO MAKE THE SIZE OF FILE DOWNLOADS MUCH SMALLER. WILL CHECK IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FILES WHICH IS THERE AND THE ONE WE WANT TO DOWNLOAD FROM THE SERVER.
ONCE THE DIFFERENCE IS FIGURED OUT WE NEED TO PATCH THE DIFFERENCE INTO THE ORIGINAL FILE THAT IS PRESENT .... SO NOW WE HAVE THE NEWEST VERSION WITH A MUCH SMALLER DOWNLOAD.

CURRENT STATUS:
1. ABLE TO READ THE FILE AND SPLIT THE FILE INTO CHUNKS.
2. ABLE TO COMBINE ALL THE TEMPORARY FILES BACK TO ORIGINAL FILE.

MORE WORK ON THE WAY!!!
